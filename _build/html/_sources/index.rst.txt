Arterial spin labeling (ASL) Data Analysis Tutorial
===================================================

This tutorial aims to demonstrate how to obtain perfusion or cerebral blood flow (CBF) using ASL MRI data collected by GE 3T MRI (or PET/MRI) scanners at Stanford University.

Pre-requisite
-------------

1 Download and install `FSL <https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki>`_

2 Download and install `dcm2niix <https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix>`_

3 Understand the basics of `ASL <http://mriquestions.com/what-is-asl.html>`_

4 Able to visualize MRI data in NIfTI format


Sample Data
-----------

We will use a sample dataset of a healthy volunteer collected by a GE 3T MRI system. The dataset includes a T1 weighted structural image and an ASL image acquired using GE's product sequence. This dataset can be downloaded here.

Voxel-wise CBF in absolute units was estimated by fitting the ASL label/control difference data to the general kinetic model using the variational Bayesian inference technque [1, 2]. The artifact on the edge of the brain due to partial volume effects was corrected using the erosion and extrapolatino technique [3].
