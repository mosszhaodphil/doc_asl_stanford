Arterial spin labeling (ASL) Data Analysis Tutorial
===================================================

This tutorial aims to demonstrate how to obtain perfusion or cerebral blood flow (CBF) using ASL MRI data collected by Stanford GE 3T MRI (or PET/MRI) scanners.

The pre-requisite of this tutorial includes:

1 Download and install `FSL <https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki>`_software package
2 Understand the basics of `ASL <http://mriquestions.com/what-is-asl.html>`_
3 Able to visualize MRI data in NIfTI format
