BASIL toolset
=============

BASIL is a collection of tools that aid in the creation of quantitative 
CBF images from ASL data. It is available within `FSL <https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki>`_ 
(v6.0.1 or later is strongly recommended). 

BASIL includes complete high-level pipelines for
processing ASL data and also individual tools for more bespoke analysis.

If you employ spatial regularisation (priors) you should ideally reference this article too:
